The idea of this repository is to provide a "barebones" or blank "canvas" UI for PoCs where the built-in Fusion UI is not enough (or too much). There are situations where we'd like to demonstrate features that are not included in the OOB Fusion Search UIs. Also, we receive questions about how to best integrate Fusion/Solr with a UI (more and more with AngularJS and client-side scripting libraries) as well as guidance on UI specific topics like "How can I best implement URL rewriting and Multi-select faceting in my UI if Solr is powering my search and navigation experience?"
